                            <p>We're entering a new era where AI systems are evolving from simple question-answering tools to sophisticated digital workers. These aren't your typical chatbots that follow basic scripts—we're talking about intelligent agents that can tackle complex business challenges by working together, learning from outcomes, and adapting their approach in real time.</p>

                            <h4>What Are AI Agents?</h4>
                            <p>Most people know language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT primarily as chatbots where you ask questions in a chat window. Through prompts like "Act as an expert in..." you can give instructions to an AI model. But this isn't the only way AI models can communicate.</p>
                            <p>LLMs can do much more than generate text when equipped with 'tools.' Think about retrieving information from the internet, entering data into spreadsheets, sending progress updates, or communicating with other AI models. AI agents combine all of these functionalities. Take a content marketing agent: it can conduct market research, identify trending topics, write blog articles, and generate accompanying images.</p>
                            <h4>From AI Agents to Agentic AI</h4>
                            <p>Agentic AI adds layers of complexity and intelligence:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Multi-Agent Collaboration:</strong> Each agent plays a role in a broader plan</li>
                                <li><strong>Task Decomposition:</strong> Breaks complex goals into parallel subtasks</li>
                                <li><strong>Memory Systems:</strong> Episodic and semantic memory to recall outcomes and optimize over time</li>
                                <li><strong>Dynamic Orchestration:</strong> Agents can delegate, negotiate, and even challenge each other's decisions</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This evolution is like going from individual performers to a symphony orchestra—where each AI agent knows its part, but also listens, reacts, and adjusts in real time. In the next article we dive deeper into what this could look like.</p>

                            <p>Most have probably seen the <a href="https://eva.avrotros.nl/artikel/alexander-klopping-laat-zien-hoe-ai-jouw-kantoorbaan-overneemt-we-hebben-marketingbureau-eva-opgericht-624" target="_blank">viral video</a> already, but considering its impact we felt like we could not leave it undiscussed: When Alexander Klopping demonstrated 'Agency Eva' on Dutch television's Eva Jinek show, viewers witnessed something unprecedented: a team of AI agents working together like human colleagues to create a complete marketing campaign in real time. What would normally take days of coordination between departments was accomplished in just 10 minutes; including target audience analysis, campaign strategy, and visual content creation.</p>
                            <div id="btn-container-agencyeva" class="btn-container">

                        <div id="content-agencyeva" class="card-content-hidden">
                            <p>The demonstration wasn't just impressive television; it was a glimpse into the future of how creative work gets done. The heart of Agency Eva consisted of seven specialized AI agents, each with distinct roles and expertise. Such as a campaign director, content expert, creative strategist, copywriter, designer, quality reviewer and social & PR specialist.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Why Multi-Agent Beats Single AI</h4>
                            <p>The power of this approach lies in specialization and focus. While a single AI model might handle simple tasks well, complex creative projects benefit enormously from division of labor.</p>
                            
                            <p>Consider the difference between asking one person to be simultaneously a strategist, copywriter, designer, and reviewer for a major campaign versus having specialists for each role. The same principle applies to AI: when each agent can focus entirely on their core expertise with detailed, specific instructions, the quality of each component dramatically improves.</p>
                            
                            <h4>The Live Collaboration Experience</h4>
                            <p>What made the television demonstration particularly compelling was the transparency of the process. Viewers could watch the AI agents communicate with each other in real time through chat messages, seeing exactly how tasks were delegated, confirmed, and completed. This visibility transformed what could have been a mysterious "black box" process into something viewers could understand and follow step-by-step.</p>

                            <p>If you thought AI was impressive for churning out scripts or enhancing video metadata, buckle up. Google just introduced Veo, a generative video model that moves us into full cinematic territory. This isn't just "AI makes a video"; it's "AI collaborates on your vision," and it could signal a major shift in how media content gets conceived and created.</p>
                            <div id="btn-container-veo" class="btn-container">

                            <p>Veo allows creators to generate high-quality video content simply from text prompts, but what makes it stand out is its attention to cinematic nuance. It understands concepts like camera movement, visual composition, lighting and even storytelling tone. Whether it's a sweeping drone shot or a dramatic slow-motion moment, Veo knows how to deliver visuals that feel crafted rather than cobbled together.</p>
                            <p>What's particularly compelling for RTL Nederland is the growing trend of AI as a creative partner rather than a novelty tool. Veo gives users more control over the final product, making it possible to iterate on scenes, adjust visual styles, and build out narratives in a way that mirrors how real-world production teams work. This level of creative collaboration opens the door to faster concept testing, more accessible previsualization and even full-on campaign development with drastically reduced turnaround times.</p>
                            <p>Google is also hinting at a broader ecosystem for Veo, including potential integration into YouTube shorts and workspace tools. That's a clear signal that AI video generation is being primed not just for experimental art, but for practical, everyday media workflows from short-form content to internal storytelling.</p>
                            <p>If your team's been wondering how AI might scale creative process at RTL Nederland without diluting the brand voice, Veo is a strong signal of what's coming next. It's less about replacing talent and more about reimagining what talented teams can do with a little machine-powered magic behind the lens.</p>

                            <p>When a filmmaker like Darren Aronofsky launches an AI studio, the media industry pays attention. The auteur behind Black Swan and The Whale is now stepping into the generative age with primordial soup, a new creative venture developed in partnership with Google Deepmind. But this isn't just another case of "Hollywood meets AI." It's a sign of where media creation is heading: a fusion of human storytelling instincts and machine-enabled experimentation.</p>
                            <div id="btn-container-aronofsky" class="btn-container">

                            <p>Primordial soup aims to explore how large language models and other generative tools can be used not to replace filmmakers, but to radically expand the creative process. This is about enhancing artistic vision, not automating it. Aronofsky describes the project as a sandbox: an exploratory space where artists can collaborate with AI to unearth new forms of narrative, visual language and cinematic expression.</p>
                            <p>The collaboration with Deepmind, Google's advanced AI research lab, adds weight to the project's ambition. This isn't about flashy gimmicks or tech demos; it's about building frameworks for storytelling that are both deeply human and powered by machines with vast creative range. It also reflects a broader industry trend: the shift from seeing ai as a post-production shortcut to embracing it as a genuine co-creator at the earliest stages of ideation.</p>
                            <p>For media professionals, this signals a growing movement toward what might be called "AI-native creativity"—stories and formats born in collaboration with algorithms, not just polished by them. It's less about automation and more about augmentation, giving creatives more bandwidth to experiment, iterate, and innovate.</p>

                    <div class="story-image">

                            <p>Netflix is redesigning its home screen and the changes say a lot about where the media industry is headed. The platform's new look, currently being tested with select users, leans into vertical video previews, tighter personalization and a browsing experience that feels unmistakably influenced by social media's most addictive formats.</p>
                            <div id="btn-container-netflix" class="btn-container">
                                <button id="btn-netflix" class="read-more-btn" onclick="toggleContent('netflix')">Read more</button>

                        <div id="content-netflix" class="card-content-hidden">
                            <p>What's new? Instead of the familiar horizontal scroll of static thumbnails, users will soon see full-screen vertical trailers auto-playing as they swipe through content: more TikTok, less traditional tv guide. It's not just a cosmetic refresh; it's a strategic pivot. Netflix is clearly betting on snackable, high-engagement formats to drive discovery in a landscape where attention spans are short and choices are overwhelming.</p>
                            <p>Under the hood, AI is doing more of the heavy lifting. The new user interface is built on smarter algorithms that serve content not just based on genre preferences but on deeper viewing behavior and real-time signals. The goal? Get the right content in front of the right viewer faster, reducing friction between "just browsing" and hitting play.</p>
                            <p>For RTL Nederland, this signals two key trends: first, the visual language of short-form video is seeping into long-form platforms, meaning content packaging now matters as much as content itself. Second, the way platforms present stories is becoming as algorithmically optimized as the stories they produce. Distribution is design and increasingly, design is driven by data.</p>
                            <p>Netflix's overhaul isn't just about aesthetics. It's a glimpse into how streaming giants are reshaping themselves to stay competitive in a world where TikTok sets the tone and AI powers the back end.</p>

                            <p>YouTube is rethinking its ad breaks, and it's not just about more commercials: it's about smarter timing. The platform is rolling out a new AI-powered system that places ads after peak moments in videos, rather than interrupting randomly. The goal? Ride the emotional wave, not kill the vibe.</p>
                            <div id="btn-container-youtube" class="btn-container">

                            <p>YouTube's machine learning models analyze a video's structure pacing, visuals, sound, and even viewer engagement data to pinpoint when a major moment lands. Once the laugh, gasp, or big reveal happens, the ad rolls in. It's a shift from disruption to strategic placement, designed to keep viewers watching while also boosting ad effectiveness.</p>
                            <p>For RTL Nederland, this is more than just an ad-tech upgrade: it signals a broader trend toward emotional intelligence in content delivery. As platforms become more context-aware, the boundaries between content, timing, and monetization continue to blur. Creators might find themselves thinking not just about story arcs, but about where AI will sense the "peak" and how that might affect the flow of their work.</p>
                            <p>It's another reminder that AI isn't just changing what we create, but how audiences experience it. And in this case, it's all about knowing when to pause.</p>

                            <p>Many companies see promising productivity gains from AI, yet struggle to translate these individual successes into broader organizational benefits. Ethan Mollick highlights three essential components to effectively realize AI's potential: Leadership, Lab, and Crowd.</p>

                            <p><strong>Leadership:</strong> Effective AI adoption begins with leadership clearly communicating an engaging vision. Leaders must move beyond generic statements about efficiency and vividly describe how AI will reshape day-to-day work. Employees seek reassurance on job security and clear guidance on how AI-driven productivity gains will impact their roles. Leadership also involves creating incentives for transparent AI usage and modeling practical AI applications actively within their workflows.</p>
                            <p><strong>Lab:</strong> Organizations should establish dedicated teams—labs—that experiment, innovate, and rapidly iterate with AI tools. Labs translate crowd-sourced ideas into practical solutions, creating benchmarks tailored to company-specific tasks. Quick, iterative experiments help organizations quickly adapt to rapid AI advancements, enabling them to remain at the forefront of innovation.</p>
                            <p><strong>Crowd:</strong> Employees—the crowd—play a pivotal role by exploring AI through daily tasks, often uncovering practical use cases that centralized strategies might overlook. However, widespread hidden AI use, driven by fear of repercussions or unclear policies, currently undermines potential gains. Companies must actively encourage openness and reward transparency in AI usage, enabling insights from employee experiences to inform broader organizational strategies.</p>
                            <p>Integrating these three elements—visionary leadership, agile experimentation through labs, and employee-driven innovation—will enable organizations to not only adopt AI more effectively but to fundamentally transform their operations and maintain competitive advantage.</p>

                            <p>A fascinating Harvard Business School <a href="https://hbr.org/2025/05/why-ceos-should-think-twice-before-using-ai-to-write-messages?ab=HP-hero-featured-1" target="_blank">study</a> at Zapier reveals a striking paradox: while employees could barely distinguish between AI-written and CEO-written messages (only 59% accuracy), they consistently rated messages they believed were AI-generated as less helpful, even when those messages were actually written by humans. This phenomenon is called "authenticity bias".</p>
                            <div id="btn-container-communication" class="btn-container">

                            <p>Researchers created a "Wade Bot" trained on Zapier CEO Wade Foster's communications, which successfully mimicked his writing style. However, the study uncovered a critical insight: perception matters more than performance. When people believed a message came from AI, they found it less valuable, regardless of its actual quality or origin.</p>
                            <p>With 50% of U.S. CEOs already using generative AI for content creation and 75% having used it personally, the technology's adoption is inevitable. The research suggests to be transparent and never rely on AI autonomously. Clearly communicate how and when you use AI tools, as hidden usage can erode trust if discovered. Also always review and fact-check AI-generated messages, as you will be responsible for sending the message.</p>
                            <p>As Wade Foster notes: "When I use gen AI, I decide whether to use what it produces, and I must stand by everything in the message."</p>
                            <p>Something to reflect on: How do you value a message when you know it was written with the help of AI? Would it change your trust in the content, even if the message resonates or feels authentic?</p>

                                            <p>In recent weeks, both Google and OpenAI have achieved a breakthrough with multimodal image generation. This means that AI can now directly create images with the same precision as text, token by token. Where previously generated text on images often changed into illegible scribbles, AI can now create professional-looking visual content with readable texts. For example, the images in part 1 and part 3 of this newsletter have been AI generated, and this technology is also used in the "AI action figure trend" mentioned in the story below.</p>

                                            <p>This technology opens up a world of new possibilities for creative professionals. The combination of precision and dialogue makes this technology particularly powerful, as you can directly consult with the AI about your images and refine them until they're perfect.</p>
                                            <p>This technology is now accessible via a free ChatGPT account, although there are limitations on the number of images you can create per day. With a paid account, you can generate images faster and without limits.</p>

                                            <p>A second fascinating development is "vibe coding," a revolutionary way to create digital products without programming knowledge. The term describes a process where you simply explain in plain language what you want to build, including the desired "vibe" or style, after which the AI generates working code. This newsletter, for example, is made completely through vibe coding in <a href="https://claude.ai" target="_blank">Claude AI</a>.</p>

                                            <p>In essence, this means: you tell AI what you want to build in natural language, and the AI converts this into working code. You don't need to program; you describe your idea, iterate a bit, and you have a working app or website. This not only speeds up the innovation process but also opens new doors for creativity because technical complexity is no longer a limitation.</p>
