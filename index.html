                            <p>In recent weeks, both Google and OpenAI have achieved a breakthrough with multimodal image generation. This means that AI can now directly create images with the same precision as text, token by token. Where previously generated text on images often changed into illegible scribbles, AI can now create professional-looking visual content with readable texts. For example, the images in part 1 and part 3 of this newsletter have been AI generated.</p>
                            <div id="btn-container-multimodal" class="btn-container">
                                <button id="btn-multimodal" class="read-more-btn" onclick="toggleContent('multimodal')">Read more</button>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div id="content-multimodal" class="card-content-hidden">
                            <p>This technology opens up a world of new possibilities for creative professionals. The combination of precision and dialogue makes this technology particularly powerful, as you can directly consult with the AI about your images and refine them until they're perfect.</p>
                            <p>This technology is now accessible via a free ChatGPT account, although there are limitations on the number of images you can create per day. With a paid account, you can generate images faster and without limits.</p>

                            <p>A second fascinating development is "vibe coding," a revolutionary way to create digital products without programming knowledge. The term describes a process where you simply explain in plain language what you want to build, including the desired "vibe" or style, after which the AI generates working code. This newsletter, for example, is made completely through vibe coding in <a href="https://claude.ai" target="_blank">Claude AI</a>.</p>
                            <div id="btn-container-vibecoding" class="btn-container">
                                <button id="btn-vibecoding" class="read-more-btn" onclick="toggleContent('vibecoding')">Read more</button>
                            </div>

                        <div id="content-vibecoding" class="card-content-hidden">
                            <p>In essence, this means: you tell AI what you want to build in natural language, and the AI converts this into working code. You don't need to program; you describe your idea, iterate a bit, and you have a working app or website. This not only speeds up the innovation process but also opens new doors for creativity because technical complexity is no longer a limitation.</p>
                            
                            <p>This feature is available (with limitations) for free in both ChatGPT and Claude AI, with the option to directly deploy the site. For a practical demonstration, we used just one prompt to create an interactive quiz about this newsletter, which you can experience <a href="https://claude.site/artifacts/94cc35cd-30bb-4257-a3c8-5ce29dad4ccc" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>The media landscape is undergoing rapid transformation as AI reshapes every aspect of content creation and consumption. BBC Research & Development has developed an framework—the "5Is"—that helps media leaders navigate this evolving territory. The media landscape is increasingly: Internet-only, Intelligent, Intermediated, Interactive, and Immersive.</p>

                                <li><strong>Internet-only:</strong> "More than half of UK households will exclusively watch TV over the internet by 2030."</li>
                                <li><strong>Intelligent:</strong> "57% of UK Millennials want their content hyper-personalised." AI systems learn and adapt over time, improving their ability to deliver content that aligns with user interests and behaviours.</li>
                                <li><strong>Intermediated:</strong> "Over 50% of UK adults use social media as a news source." To maintain a direct and independent relationship with audiences, it is necessary to understand and work with the platforms and (AI) agents that mediate this interaction.</li>
                                <li><strong>Interactive:</strong> "Interactive content generates a 52% higher engagement rate than static content". Today's audiences prefer dynamic interactions, which AI enables by adjusting content in real-time based on user input for personalized experiences.</li>
                                <li><strong>Immersive:</strong> "By 2025, […] 95% (roughly 65 million people) will be smartphone users users." Through technologies like virtual and augmented reality, AI can contribute to creating more immersive content environments, enhancing user engagement.</li>

                        <p>Deloitte's recent analysis of agentic AI positions agentic AI as "the new frontier in AI evolution". Unlike conventional AI systems that simply respond to queries or perform discrete tasks, agentic AI operates with significantly more autonomy—understanding context, setting sub-goals, and adapting to changing conditions without constant human direction.</p>
                        <div id="btn-container-agentic">

                            <p>According to Deloitte's research, this shift represents a fundamental evolution from "tools" to "partners". For media organizations, this means AI systems that can independently research topics, identify relevant insights, suggest (creative) angles, draft initial content, and even evaluate potential audience reception—all while maintaining alignment with editorial guidelines and brand voice.</p>
                            <p>What makes this development particularly significant for media leaders is its potential to address the industry's persistent challenge of balancing quality with efficiency. As Deloitte notes: "These agents will be more accurate, sophisticated, and accessible, potentially having their own marketplaces and info exchange systems."</p>
                            <p>One media strategist from the IAB (Internet Architecture Board) describes it in a seminar (Agentic AI: What Is It and How Will It Change Advertising?) discussing Agentic AI that "they are great for automating things that never stop, like optimizing websites, allocating budgets, tracking social media all day to uncover the trends in real time for companies to react to or shift their marketing around. We as humans just aren't built to be able to handle so much data at the same time". By offloading repetitive decision-making and executional tasks, Agentic AI can free up human creatives to focus on brand storytelling and innovation—making it a powerful force multiplier for media organizations ready to lead in the AI era.</p>
                            <p>In the upcoming newsletter, we will dive deep into Agentic AI by discussing one of the frontrunning Agentic AI tool, N8N.</p>

                            <p>InfoSum's technology enables advertisers to connect diverse data sources without actually moving or sharing the underlying information—a capability that grows increasingly valuable as privacy regulations tighten and third-party cookies phase out. The platform uses advanced AI to derive insights while maintaining strict data separation protocols.</p>
                            <p>Mark Read, CEO of WPP, described the acquisition as "At WPP, we have been building the technology and data infrastructure that will give our clients a unique competitive advantage in the AI era."</p>

                        <p>As AI takes over more tasks, an interesting paradox emerges: this technology can actually encourage more human leadership. Recent research by leadership experts Rasmus Hougaard and Jacqueline Carter, described in their book "More Human," shows that AI offers three important benefits for leaders.</p>
                        <div id="btn-container-leaders">

                        <div id="content-leaders" class="card-content-hidden">
                            <p>First, leaders achieve significant time savings on administrative tasks. A CHRO at Accenture discovered that AI reduced the time spent gathering information for performance reviews from 45 minutes to just 5 minutes. This creates space for what truly matters: listening to employees and paying attention to their development.</p>
                            <p>Second, AI offers possibilities for customization in leadership style by helping to analyze individual needs and preferences of team members. And finally, AI can support strengthening human qualities such as empathy and awareness. At Mastercard, chief people officer Michael Fraccaro is experimenting with an AI coach, with which he practices challenging conversations in the workforce and receives recommendations.</p>
                            <p>The challenge for modern leaders is to use AI not to replace human contact, but to deepen it.</p>

                                <li><strong>Breaking down silos:</strong> AI helps specialists embrace each other's fields. In the experiment, the boundaries between R&D professionals and commercial experts completely blurred: R&D people came up with strongly commercial ideas, and commercial people devised technical solutions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Positive work experience:</strong> Technological changes are often associated with more stress and less job satisfaction. In this experiment, AI users actually experienced more positive emotions (such as enthusiasm and energy) and suffered less from negative feelings like anxiety and frustration.</li>
